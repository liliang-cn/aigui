### Minor Changes

- Prompt specs teach the block shape that actually parses.

  Eleven specs demonstrated their block on a single line — ` ```list {"items":[…]}``` `
  — and a model that copies that exactly produces no block at all. A fence's
  info string may not contain backticks, so CommonMark reads the line as an
  inline code span: the reader gets raw JSON running through the middle of a
  sentence, and an empty code block where the list should have been. The
  mistake is invisible from the model's side, which emitted precisely what it
  was shown.

  Every spec now shows the multi-line form, `buildSystemPrompt` states the rule
  once before the specs it governs (new export: `fencingRule`), and a test lints
  every package's model-facing text so the shape cannot come back.

  Hosts that assemble guidance themselves rather than calling `buildSystemPrompt`
  should prepend `fencingRule(locale)`.

### Patch Changes

- First release of `@ai-gui/plugin-resultset`: host-owned result tables. The
  application appends a ` ```resultset ` block from the rows it really returned,
  and the prompt spec tells the model not to retype figures into its prose.
  `plugin-evidence` proves which query ran; this proves the number in the sentence
  came from it.

### Patch Changes

- First release of `@ai-gui/plugin-evidence`: host-owned query provenance. The
  application appends an ` ```evidence ` fence from the statements it actually
  executed, and `evidencePromptSpec()` tells the model never to write one — a
  model that can invent a number can invent the query said to have produced it.

### Patch Changes

- a06c692: **The view box now holds the angle marks, the labels and the hatching.**

  It was measured from bodies, surfaces and vector tips only. Everything else a mechanics diagram draws
  sits outside those: the `30°` at the foot of an incline is an arc 28 from its vertex with a label 14
  further out and was measured by nothing at all, so on any diagram whose incline reaches the left edge it
  was simply outside the picture — the one label a 斜面 diagram cannot do without. A vector's label is
  written past its arrowhead and then runs the width of its own text, so "mg cos(30°)" hung off the frame
  beside an arrow pointing at nothing. Hatching hangs below its surface by its own length.

  Text is estimated rather than measured — this renders to a string, with no DOM to measure in — and errs
  wide: CJK at a full em, Latin at half. A box slightly too big shows white space; one slightly too small
  cuts a word in half. An explicit `view` is still left exactly as given.

### Minor Changes

- New: force and vector diagrams for teaching mechanics.

  A ```physics block declares bodies, surfaces, vectors and angles, and the plugin draws them as SVG —
  the picture a textbook draws for a block on an incline, with the forces labelled and one of them
  resolved into components.

  It is a drawing, not a simulation. A rigid-body engine produces a collision that looks right and
  gives a teacher no way to label the intermediate quantities, stop at three seconds, or show a force
  in equilibrium that never moves anything. Coordinates in, faithful picture out; the numbers are the
  model's to get right.

  y increases upwards and angles run counter-clockwise from the positive x axis, because that is how a
  mechanics problem states them — "60° above the horizontal", "gravity at -90". Colours come from CSS
  custom properties over currentColor, so a diagram follows the page it is on.
