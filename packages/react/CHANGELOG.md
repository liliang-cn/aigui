### Minor Changes

- 57d6aef: A plugin can declare that it built its own markup, and Vue and vanilla catch up with React.

  `RenderOutput` html takes `trusted: true`. Sanitizing a diagram strips the `foreignObject` that
  holds every label in it, so hosts bypassed their sanitizer by matching the mermaid plugin's
  internal id prefix with a regular expression — which broke whenever the plugin renamed its ids and
  let any model output wearing that prefix through unsanitized. The mermaid plugin now says so
  itself, and a host that disagrees sets `sanitize: { trustPlugins: false }`. The three framework
  bindings share one `sanitizeRenderedHtml` so they cannot drift apart on what sanitizing means.

  Vue and vanilla receive the host contract 0.5.0 gave React. Both take a theme and hand it to
  plugins — 0.5.0 put the theme in the `NodeRenderer` contract but only React passed it, so a Vue or
  vanilla app with plugin-chart still drew a light plot area on a dark page. Vue takes a `text` prop
  and emits `render`; vanilla gains `setText`, `setTheme` and an `onRender` option, so neither is
  back to keeping its own record of what it already pushed.

  `exportImages` is on the React handle, the Vue expose and the vanilla renderer. The element the
  drawings live in belongs to the renderer, so finding them was the host's problem.

- 401fce1: Let the host describe what it wants rendered instead of driving the renderer by hand.

  `AIRenderer` takes a `text` prop and works out the delta itself. Streaming an answer meant every
  host kept its own record of what it had already pushed, diffed against it, noticed when the new
  text was not a continuation, and reset — and then had to undo that record when StrictMode's
  remount emptied the renderer underneath it.

  `onRender` reports the nodes on screen. Knowing whether an answer produced a chart previously
  meant watching the DOM for whatever elements a plugin happened to create.

  `theme` reaches plugins through a second argument to `NodeRenderer`, so a diagram or a chart can
  follow the page it is embedded in. Mermaid re-initialises when the theme changes rather than
  freezing on whichever diagram rendered first, and charts pass the scheme to ECharts.

  `exportSVGToImage`, `exportRenderedImages` and `downloadImage` save what a plugin drew. Every host
  was rewriting the serialize-load-canvas dance, and getting the background and the pixel ratio
  wrong in its own way.

  The renderer session is now keyed on the plugins themselves rather than the array holding them.
  `plugins={[chart, katex]}` is a new array on every render, and rebuilding the session for it threw
  away the answer mid-stream.

## 0.4.4

### Patch Changes

- Keep the React renderer alive across effect remounts. `useAIRenderer` only armed its patch
  token while creating a session, so once the mount effect had been torn down and re-run on the
  same session — which React StrictMode does on every mount in development, and Fast Refresh does
  on edit — `push` and `feed` became silent no-ops and the rendered output stayed blank. The mount
  effect now re-arms the active session token.
